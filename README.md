# Tetroid Testing Branch
A lightweight version of our project which only includes the source code, the best weights for our approximate learning agent, and a startup script. This does not contain any latex, pdf, or image files and also does not use git-lfs. 

## Cloning and Setup
To clone this branch, run `git clone --single-branch --branch test <remote-url>`. The only dependency that is needed for this project is [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news).

## Usage
To watch the agent play the game, simply run `./startup.sh`. To play a game of tetris for yourself, run `python src/tetris.py`.

### Notes
Initial contributions made by Soumil Singh are not linked to his Github account because of configuration issues.
