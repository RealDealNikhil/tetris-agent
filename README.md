# Tetroid
A Tetris reinforcement learning agent by Nikhil Suri and Soumil Singh. Read about our project purpose, specification, experiments methodology, discussion of results, and usage in our [final paper](docs/final-paper.pdf).

This project uses [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/). Read about how we managed our large files of learned values after training sessions [here](values/README.md).

## Cloning
Cloning this project in its entirety requires [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com). To clone a lightweight version which only includes weights learned by our best agent, clone our `test` branch with `git clone --single-branch --branch test <remote-url>`. Cloning the `test` branch does not require git-lfs, though it does require [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news). See our `test` branch [here](https://github.com/RealDealNikhil/tetris-agent/tree/test).

### Notes
Initial contributions made by Soumil Singh are not linked to his Github account because of configuration issues.
